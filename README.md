# Project-I - Pandas

# Overview

This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information on shark attacks worldwide. Using Python and the Pandas library, the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing data and converting data types. The analysis includes exploring factors such as the top countries with shark attacks, temporal patterns, types of attacks, and fatality rates. Visualization techniques, including line plots, bar charts, are used to convey key insights and trends in the data.

# Libraries

Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# Hypotheses 

1. Geographical Analysis:
What are the top 10 countries with the highest number of recorded shark attacks?

2. Fatalities:
What percentage of shark attacks result in fatalities?

3. Attack Types:
What are the most common types of shark attacks (e.g., provoked, unprovoked, boating-related)?

4. Activity Analysis:
What are the top 10 activities with the highest number of recorded shark attacks?
Is there a correlation between the fatality rate and factors like the location of the attack,
the type of attack involved?

5. Temporal Analysis:
How has the frequency of shark attacks changed over the years? (1900 to 2018)
Analyse the season,  time of the year in months
checking if there;s a pattern, season or time of the year it happens the attacks happen


# 1. Geographical Analysis:

In the geographical analysis, the top 10 countries with the highest recorded shark attacks over the years was examined. The leading three countries in this list are the United States, Australia, and South Africa. Below, you'll find the complete list of the top 10 countries, along with the respective number of shark attacks reported throughout the years.

Country         Shark Attacks
USA                 2228
AUSTRALIA           1338
SOUTH AFRICA         579
PAPUA NEW GUINEA     134
NEW ZEALAND          128
BRAZIL               112
BAHAMAS              109
MEXICO                89
ITALY                 71
FIJI                  62

# 2. Fatalities:

In this section, is presented an overview of the fatality percentage of shark attacks over the years. Generally, 24.1% of these incidents resulted in fatalities, while the majority, accounting for 75.9%, were non-fatal. Subsequent sections will delve into the trends and variations in shark attacks over time, as well as highlight the months with higher attack frequencies.


# 3. Attack Types:

In terms of Shark Attacks Types, when categorizing shark attacks, they are typically classified into the following primary types:

Unprovoked: These incidents occur when individuals are engaged in activities such as swimming, surfing, or similar water-based pursuits.

Provoked: This category encompasses incidents linked to interactions where people intentionally provoke sharks, such as when feeding them or engaging in fishing activities.

Boating: These incidents involve individuals who are on the water in vessels like kayaks, participating in activities like kayak fishing, and so forth.


# 4. Activity Analysis

In this section, is presented the top 10 activities that have resulted in shark attacks, as indicated by the following list:

Activity
Surfing 971
Swimming 867
Fishing 431
Spearfishing 332
Bathing 162
Wading 149
Diving 127
Standing 99
Snorkeling 89
Scuba diving 76

These activities have been categorized into three main groups: Water Sports, Swimming, and Fishing, allowing for a comparison of the overall number of attacks within each activity. Additionally, the correlation between the fatality rate and the specific activity associated with the shark attack was analyzed.

# 5. Temporal Analysis:

In the Temporal Analysis, two key investigations were conducted. First, the seasonal and monthly patterns of shark attacks to identify when they are more likely to occur. It was also assessed how the frequency of shark attacks has changed from 1900 to 2018, uncovering long-term trends and variations. These analyses offer a comprehensive understanding of the temporal aspects of shark attacks.


# Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis reveals the United States and Australia are the countries with the highest number of recorded shark attacks, highlighting their prevalence over the years. Moreover, despite the substantial reports of shark encounters, there's a promising trend: a decline in shark attack fatalities over time.

However, it's evident that human activities continue to occur in areas with a potential shark presence, such as fishing, swimming, and surfing. This suggests a need for heightened awareness and safety measures.

When examining the correlation between the nature of activities and shark attack fatalities, a noteworthy trend emerges. Those engaged in water sports exhibit a higher likelihood of survival compared to individuals involved in activities like swimming, potentially reflecting their greater experience and preparedness in dealing with potential encounters.
